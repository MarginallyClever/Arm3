This package defines API modeled after
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Information Set</a>
for building incrmentally XML trees
from events streamed from pull parser
(user can start navigating tree before whole XML input was parsed!)
and has an unique ability to bypass tree building for selected sub trees
to work directly with underlying event stream.
This coupled with ability to create XML tree that can mix in any
Java Object allows to represent objects derived from XML (databinding)
in the XML tree.


<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>unique ability</b> to achieve high performance that is common in streaming parsers
and ease of use associated with tree approaches in the same API
by provising very precise control over XML tree creation and access
to underlying streaming parser <strong>during</strong> tree creation
(API users needs to do it if and only if they do want to bypass default tree
creation and replace it with their customized object tree, work directly with XML
events or just skip unneded parts of XML that do not need to be in XML node tree).

<li><b>easy to use</b>: modeled after <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML
Information Set</a>
to build on well established abstract model to represent XML
<li><b>small</b>: only few classes and interfaces
<li><b>fast</b>: builds on the most powerful XmlPull API that makes possible to create
high perfromance parser implemntations

<li><b>flexible: based on the state of the art interface-implementation approach
allowing anybody to modify and extend easily API
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>API is directly modeled on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Information Set</a>
with few minor exceptions but expands on it to provide additional functions to create
and manipulate XML Information Set (essentially providing
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#intro.synthetic">Synthetic Infoset</a>).

<h3>TODO:</h3>
<ul>
<li>when generics are supported in JDK upgrade API to use Iterator&lt;T> instead of Enumeration ...
