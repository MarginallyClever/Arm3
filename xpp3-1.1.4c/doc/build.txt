Building XPP3
-------------

If ANT 1.4+ and JUnit 3.7 is already available use provided build.xml
otherwise you can use provided ANT if full distribution was downloaded
and or taken from CVS, if source distribution was downloaded please
look into lib/anr and lib/junit and put required jar files there.

XPP3 can be built uning a simple scripted build system on top ANT
that will work if ANT jar files are present in lib/ant direcotry
(see this directory for instructions how to get ANT files).
If ANT is already available on CLASSPATH it can be used directly.

First make sure that JAVA_HOME environment variable points
to your installation of JDK version 1.1 or above.

If you want to use other ANT verion simply replace JAR files already existing
in lib subdirectory (check README.txt files there for description).

To build XPP3 from scratch use build script 
* on UNIX it is ./build.sh and 
* on WINDOWS build.bat refered here as "build":
and then call

  build all (on UNIX usie./build.sh)

For more documentation please browse to XMLPULL website at http://www.xmlpull.org
  


Building and executing automatic tests
--------------------------------------

NOTE: those tests are to verify implementation of XMLPULL API V1 and
they are taken from http://www.xmlpull.org

To execute tests you can use ANT target called "junit" 
(make sure that JUnit is on CLASSPATH!!!)

  build junit
	
and you should see all tests passed successfully, similarly to:

junit:
     [java] ...............
     [java] Time: 0.151
     [java]
     [java] OK (15 tests)
     [java]

now you can start using XMLPULL, see provided samples in src/java/samples
and read documentation at http://www.xmlpull.org

Please report bugs to http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/soap/xpp/

Thanks!
