Start
-----
Double click start32.bat or start64.bat.
Depending on what kind of computer you have one or the other should work.

Locating Java
-------------
If the software won't run it's probably because the batch file can't find java.exe.
Either you don't have java installed or your java installation is corrupt because
the bat file can't find the registry key for

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Javasoft\Java Runtime Environment\CurrentVersion

Most of the time this can be solved by reinstalling Java.
If that doesn't work, please use our forums for more help.
