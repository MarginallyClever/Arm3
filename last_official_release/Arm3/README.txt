Software for Arm3 robot

last updated 2015-01-22

Start
-----
Double click Arm3.jar.



OSX
---
If that doesn't work, try start.command.
If that doesn't work, please use our support forums for more help.



Windows
---
If that doesn't work, try start win32.bat.
If that doesn't work, try start win64.bat.

If the software won't run it's probably because the batch file can't find java.exe.
Either you don't have java installed or your java installation is corrupt because
the bat file can't find the registry key for

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Javasoft\Java Runtime Environment\CurrentVersion

Most of the time this can be solved by reinstalling Java.
If that doesn't work, please use our support forums for more help.
