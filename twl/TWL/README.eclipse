To set up Eclipse for building TWL, a couple steps are needed.

Before starting, you will need to download the following packages, and unzip them somewhere on your PC:

* lwjgl-2.4.2.zip from http://www.lwjgl.org/
* xpp3-1.1.4c_all.zip (or later) from http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/dist/java-repository/xpp3/distributions/

The contents of these files are included in the TWL required libraries archive:
 
http://twl.l33tlabs.org/demo/twl.zip

1. Open the Eclipse preferences panel (Window menu, Preferences)
2. Navigate to Java/Build Path/User Libraries
3. Click "New" to add a User Library, name it "LWJGL". It is not a system library.
4. Select "LWJGL" in the list, and click "Add JARs".
5. Navigate to the LWJGL distribution directory, and select the following jar files: jinput.jar, lwjgl.jar, lwjgl_util.jar
6. Click "New" to add another User Library, name it "XPP3". It is not a system library.
7. Select "XPP3" in the list, and click "Add JARs".
8. Navigate to the XPP3 distribution directory, and select the following jar files: xpp3-1.1.4c.jar

Once these steps are complete, TWL will compile.
